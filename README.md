# Contail ScreenSaver

Contail is a ScreenSaver for OS X that follows a text/log file of your choice. If you're interested in what's going on with your machine, even while a ScreenSaver is running, this is for you (and the reason that opendirectoryd.log is the default log file).

I've written and tested this on 10.7, and it's unlikely to work on anything earlier (due to the use of CoreText and my default choice of opendirectoryd.log).
